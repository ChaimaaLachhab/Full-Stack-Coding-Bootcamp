    <script>
        const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
        const promise2 = 42;
        const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout(resolve, 3000, 'foo');
        });

        Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
            .then(values => {
                console.log("Resolved values:", values);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.error("One of the promises rejected:", error);
            });

        /*
        How Promise.all works:

        - It takes an array of promises.
        - It waits until **all** promises resolve.
        - If they do, it returns a single promise with an array of the resolved values.
        - If **any** promise is rejected, it immediately rejects with that error.

        In this case:
        - promise1 resolves immediately with 3
        - promise2 is just a number (42), treated as resolved
        - promise3 resolves after 3 seconds with 'foo'

        So, the final output after 3 seconds: [3, 42, "foo"]
